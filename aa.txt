1. Introduction to Software Engineering
Definition: Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development.
Need for SE: Reduces complexity, ensures quality, lowers cost, and improves maintainability.
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
Phases: Requirement Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
Characteristics of Software: Scalability, reusability, flexibility, reliability.
2. Software Development Models
Waterfall Model: Sequential approach; phases completed one at a time.
Iterative Model: Cycles through iterations for incremental development.
Spiral Model: Combines iterative development with risk analysis.
Agile Model: Emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback.
V-Model: Validation and verification at every stage.
3. Software Requirements
Types of Requirements:
Functional: What the system should do.
Non-Functional: Performance, security, usability, etc.
Requirement Engineering:
Steps: Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, Validation, and Management.
Techniques: Interviews, surveys, use cases, prototypes.
4. System Design
Types of Design:
High-Level Design (HLD): Architecture, module design.
Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed module coding.
Design Principles: Modularity, abstraction, cohesion, and coupling.
UML (Unified Modeling Language):
Diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, and Component diagrams.
5. Coding and Implementation
Coding Standards: Guidelines to write consistent, readable, and maintainable code.
Programming Practices: Version control, unit testing, code reviews.
Tools: IDEs, debuggers, compilers.
6. Software Testing
Types of Testing:
Unit Testing: Testing individual components.
Integration Testing: Testing combined modules.
System Testing: End-to-end system validation.
Acceptance Testing: Validation by the end user.
Testing Techniques:
Black-Box Testing: Testing without knowing internal code.
White-Box Testing: Testing with knowledge of internal structure.
7. Software Quality Assurance (SQA)
Definition: Ensures the quality of the software through processes, tools, and standards.
Key Metrics: Defect density, reliability, maintainability.
Quality Models: ISO 9126, CMMI, Six Sigma.
8. Maintenance and Evolution
Types of Maintenance:
Corrective: Fixing defects.
Adaptive: Updating for environment changes.
Perfective: Improving performance or maintainability.
Preventive: Preventing future problems.
Challenges: Cost, complexity, regression issues.
9. Software Project Management
Activities: Planning, scheduling, resource allocation, risk management.
Estimation Techniques:
COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model).
Function Point Analysis (FPA).
Project Management Tools: Gantt charts, PERT charts, MS Project.
10. Advanced Topics in Software Engineering
DevOps: Integration of development and operations for faster delivery.
Agile Frameworks: Scrum, Kanban.
Software Reengineering: Modifying legacy systems to improve performance.
CASE Tools: Automated tools for software engineering (e.g., Rational Rose).
